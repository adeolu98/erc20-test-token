# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```



to use this project:

- `yarn add` to add all dependencies 
- enter hardhat.config.js and set all environment variables listed there
- run `npx hardhat compile` 
- run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your preferred network>` to deploy the token
